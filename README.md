# [Walk2Watch](https://walk2watch.netlify.app/)

This project aims to help me with my YouTube addiction.

* Apple [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d697dcd0c944ec890df3fe636f8fe5e) which is run automaticy once a day to sync data from Health App (steps in particular).
* Netlify functions to handle watch-time and steps syncrhonization.
* Simple dashboard to show how much time I've got to watch.

The formula is simple: **for every 1k steps I can watch 5 mins of YouTube**.
